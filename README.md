## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/87a2c8c0-a491-491c-867d-7c092b5d4541) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Before running the app, create a `.env` file from `.env.example` and set `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_KEY` with your Supabase project credentials.

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Copy the example environment file and add your Supabase credentials.
cp .env.example .env

# Step 4: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 5: Start the development server.
npm start
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
